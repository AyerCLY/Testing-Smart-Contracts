Chapter 13: More Expressive Assertions with Chai

Until now, we've been using the built-in assert module to write our assertions. While not bad, the assert module has a major drawback- the code doesn't read well. Fortunately, there are several better assertion modules out there, and Chai is one of the best.

That said, let's take a look at the three kinds of assertion styles bundled into Chai:

expect: lets you chain natural language assertions as follows:

let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
expect(lessonTitle).to.be.a("string");
should: allows for similar assertions as expect interface, but the chain starts with a should property:

let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
lessonTitle.should.be.a("string");
assert: provides a notation similar to that packaged with node.js and includes several additional tests and it's browser compatible:

let lessonTitle = "Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle";
assert.typeOf(lessonTitle, "string");
In this chapter, we are going to show you how to improve your assertions with expect.
Note: We're assuming the chai package is already installed on your computer. If that's not the case, you can easily install it like so: npm -g install chai
