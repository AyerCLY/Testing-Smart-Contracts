//Before deploying to Ethereum, it is best to test your smart contracts locally.
//You can do so by using a tool called Ganache, which sets up a local Ethereum network.
//Every time Ganache starts, it creates 10 test accounts and gives them 100 Ethers to make testing easier. 
//Since Ganache and Truffle are tightly integrated we can access these accounts through the accounts array 
//we've mentioned in the previous chapter.
    
//Build Artifacts
//Every time you compile a smart contract, the Solidity compiler generates a JSON file (referred to as build artifacts) 
//which contains the binary representation of that contract and saves it in the build/contracts folder.
//Next, when you run a migration, Truffle updates this file with the information related to that network.

//The first thing you'll need to do every time you start writing a new test suite is to load 
//the build artifacts of the contract you want to interact with. 
//This way, Truffle will know how to format our function calls in a way the contract will understand.

//Let's look at a simple example.
//Say there was a contract called MyAwesomeContract. We could do something like the following to load the build artifacts:
//const MyAwesomeContract = artifacts.require(‚ÄúMyAwesomeContract‚Äù);

const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies);
                                            
//In order to keep our tests nice and tidy we've moved the code above to helpers/utils.js and imported it into ‚ÄúCryptoZombies.js‚Äù like so:
const utils = require("./helpers/utils");                                        

//Calling createRandomZombie requires us to pass it the zombie's name as a parameter. 
//So, the next step would be to give a name to Alice's zombie. Something like ‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs Awesome Zombie‚Äù.  
//However, if we do this for each test, our code is not going to look pretty. 
/*
A better approach is to initialize a global array as follows:
const zombieNames = ["Zombie #1", "Zombie #2"];

And then, call the contract's methods like so:
contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[0]);
*/
//Note: Using an array to store zombies' names comes in handy if you want, for example, to write a test that creates 1000 zombies instead of just one or twoüòâ.
//initialized the zombieNames array for you
const zombieNames = ["Zombie 1", "Zombie 2"];

//Usually, every test has the following phases:
//set up: in which we define the initial state and initialize the inputs.
//act: where we actually test the code. Always make sure you test only one thing.
//assert: where we check the results.


//The contract() function
//Behind the scenes, Truffle adds a thin wrapper around Mocha in order to make testing simpler. Since our course focuses on Ethereum development, we won't be spending much time explaining the bits and bytes of Mocha. If you're inclined to learn more about Mocha, check out their website, once you're done with this lesson. 
//For now, you only have to understand what we cover here - how to:
//1. group tests by calling a function named contract(). It extends Mocha's describe() by providing a list of accounts 
//for testing and doing some cleanup as well.
//2. contract() takes two arguments. The first one, a string, must indicate what we‚Äôre going to test. 
//The second parameter, a callback, is where we‚Äôre going to actually write our tests.
//3. execute them: the way we‚Äôll be doing this is by calling a function named it() which also takes two arguments: 
//a string that describes what the test actually does and a callback.
/*
Putting it together, here's a bare-bones test:
 contract("MyAwesomeContract", (accounts) => {
   it("should be able to receive Ethers", () => {
   })
 })
*/
contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {

     //1. initialize `alice` and `bob`
    let [alice, bob] = accounts;
    

    // creat hooks
    //Note: We want contractInstance to be limited in scope to the block in which it's defined. Use let instead of var.
    let contractInstance;
    
//A. Set up: in which we define the initial state and initialize the inputs.
//In Chapter 2, you learned to create a contract abstraction. 
//However, a contract abstraction, as its name says, is just an abstraction. 
//*****In order to actually interact with our smart contract, we have to create a JavaScript object 
//*****that will act as an instance of the contract. 
//Continuing our example with MyAwesomeContract, we can use the contract abstraction to initialize our instance like this:
//const contractInstance = await MyAwesomeContract.new(); 
    //Wouldn't be nice if you could write this just once and have Truffle run it automatically for every test?
    //So, instead of writing contract.new() several times, you just do it once like this:
   beforeEach(async () => {
        // let's put here the code that creates a new contract instance
       //CryptoZombies.new() "talks" to the blockchain. This means that it's an asynchronous function. Let's add the await keyword before the function call.

/*Logs and Events
Once we specified the contract we wanted to test using artifacts.require, Truffle automatically provides the logs generated by our 
smart contract. What this means is that we can now retrieve the name of Alice's newly created zombie using something like this: 

result.logs[0].args.name. In a similar fashion, we can get the id and the _dna.

Besides these bits of information, result is going to be giving us several other useful details about the transaction:
result.tx: the transaction hash
result.receipt: an object containing the transaction receipt. 
If result.receipt.status is equal to true it means that the transaction was successful. Otherwise, it means that the transaction failed.

Note: Note that logs can also be used as a much cheaper option to store data. 
The downside is that they can't be accessed from within the smart contract itself.

This test is pretty straightforward and consists of the following steps:

First, we're going to be creating two new zombies - one for Alice and the other one for Bob.
Second, Alice will run attack on her zombie with Bob's zombieId as a parameter
Finally, for the test to pass, we are going to check if result.receipt.status equals true
While we're here, let's say I've quickly coded all this logic, wrapped it in an it() function, and run truffle test.

Our test just failed‚òπÔ∏è.

But why?

Let's figure it out. First, we're going to take a closer look at the code behind createRandomZombie():

function createRandomZombie(string _name) public {
  require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);
  uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
  randDna = randDna - randDna % 100;
  _createZombie(_name, randDna);
}
So far so good. Moving forward, let's dig into _createZombie():

function _createZombie(string _name, uint _dna) internal {
  uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna, 1, uint32(now + cooldownTime), 0, 0)) - 1;
  zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender;
  ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] = ownerZombieCount[msg.sender].add(1);
  emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
}
Ohh, you see the issue?

Our test failed because we've added a cooldown period to our game, and made it so zombies have to wait 1 day after attacking (or feeding) to attack again.
*/
    it("zombies should be able to attack another zombie", async () => {
        let result;
        result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[0], {from: alice});
        const firstZombieId = result.logs[0].args.zombieId.toNumber();
        result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[1], {from: bob});
        const secondZombieId = result.logs[0].args.zombieId.toNumber(); //why logs[0]?not duplicate?
        //TODO: increase the time
        //evm_increaseTime: increases the time for the next block.
        //evm_mine: mines a new block.
        /*
        Let me explain how these functions work:

        Every time a new block gets mined, the miner adds a timestamp to it. Let's say the transactions that created our zombies got mined in block 5.

        Next, we call evm_increaseTime but, since the blockchain is immutable, there is no way of modifying an existing block. So, when the contract checks the time, it will not be increased.

        If we run evm_mine, block number 6 gets mined (and timestamped) which means that, when we put the zombies to fight, the smart contract will "see" that a day has passed.

        Putting it together, we can fix our test by traveling through time as follows:

        await web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        method: "evm_increaseTime",
        params: [86400],  // there are 86400 seconds in a day
        id: new Date().getTime()
        }, () => { });

        Yeah, that‚Äôs a nice piece of code, but we wouldn‚Äôt want to add this logic to our CryptoZombies.js file.

        We‚Äôve gone ahead and moved everything to a new file named helpers/time.js. To increase the time, you'll simply have to call: time.increaseTime(86400);
        */
        await time.increase(time.duration.days(1))
        await contractInstance.attack(firstZombieId, secondZombieId, {from: alice});
        assert.equal(result.receipt.status, true);
    })
})
